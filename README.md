This is a simple calculator for calculating the hub and authority weight in the Hit Algorithm from the provided adjacency matrix.

The weights are normalized with number of vertices. For example, given 3 vertices, the normalized weight for hub and authority are sum up to 3 respectively.

The program will terminate only after the both weights convergence.
